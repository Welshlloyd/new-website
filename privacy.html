    <h1>Privacy Policy ‚Äî The Woof of Walk Street Pty Ltd</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: October&nbsp;2025</em></p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how The Woof of Walk Street Pty Ltd (‚Äúwe‚Äù, ‚Äúour‚Äù, ‚Äúus‚Äù) collects, uses, stores and protects your personal information.  
    We are committed to safeguarding your privacy in accordance with the <strong>Privacy Act 1988 (Cth)</strong> and the <strong>Australian Privacy Principles (APPs)</strong>.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect personal information that helps us provide dog walking, boarding and membership services.  
    This may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your name, address, email address and phone number;</li>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use your information to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide and manage our services (dog walking, boarding, memberships);</li>
      <li>Communicate with you about bookings, payments and updates;</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>3. Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>We store personal information in secure digital systems protected by passwords, encryption and access controls.  
    Only authorised team members have access to client data.  
    While we take reasonable precautions to prevent unauthorised access or misuse, no system is completely secure, and you provide information at your own risk.</p>

    <h2>4. Sharing of Information</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, rent or trade your personal information.  
    We may share limited details only where necessary to:</p>

      <li>Comply with insurance, legal or regulatory obligations;</li>
      <li>Respond to law enforcement requests where required by law.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Third-party providers (such as payment gateways or GPS tracking apps) are required to protect your information under their own privacy policies, which we review before use.</p>

    <h2>5. Cookies and Website Data</h2>
    <p>Our website may use cookies or analytics tools (such as Google Analytics) to measure site traffic and performance.  
    These tools do not identify you personally.  
    You can disable cookies in your browser settings, although this may affect website functionality.</p>

    <p>We may occasionally send updates, special offers or newsletters to clients.  
    You can unsubscribe at any time using the link in our emails or by contacting us directly.</p>

    <h2>7. Access and Correction</h2>
    <p>You may request access to your personal information at any time.  
    If you believe that any information we hold is inaccurate or incomplete, please contact us and we‚Äôll correct it promptly.</p>

    <h2>8. Overseas Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We generally do not share personal information outside Australia.  
    If we ever need to use offshore cloud storage or services, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that your information is protected under equivalent privacy standards.</p>

    <h2>9. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We keep personal information only as long as needed for business or legal purposes.  
    When it is no longer required, we securely delete or anonymise it.</p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.  
    The latest version will always be available on our website.
