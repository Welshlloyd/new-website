    All walks are GPS-tracked, insured, and conducted by trained handlers.  
    Weekend Woof Club boarding includes accommodation, supervised exercise, and general care.  
    Services are available only within the designated Service Areas and subject to staff availability and safety conditions.</p>

    <h2>4. Membership Terms (Starter, Growth and Unlimited Pawfolio)</h2>
    <p>
      4.1 <strong>Membership Overview.</strong> The Woof of Walk Street offers recurring membership options that provide pre-paid walking credits each month. Memberships renew automatically until cancelled in accordance with these Terms.
    </p>

    <p>
      4.2 <strong>Membership Tiers and Pricing (AUD inc GST):</strong><br>
      • <strong>Starter Membership — $340 per month:</strong> includes 4 solo walks per month (30 minutes each).<br>
      • <strong>Growth Membership — $800 per month:</strong> includes 10 solo walks per month (30 minutes each).<br>
      • <strong>Unlimited Pawfolio Membership — $1,500 per month:</strong> includes up to 21 weekday solo walks per calendar month, subject to the fair-use provisions below.
    </p>

    <p>
      4.3 <strong>Fair-Use Limitation (Unlimited Pawfolio).</strong> For the purposes of operational fairness and scheduling integrity, “Unlimited” access shall be construed as a maximum of twenty-one (21) weekday walks per calendar month. The Service Provider may, at its sole discretion, approve additional walks beyond this limit at the prevailing casual rate and subject to resource availability.
    </p>

    <p>
      4.4 <strong>Expiry of Walk Credits.</strong> All walk entitlements allocated under a Membership must be utilised within the corresponding billing cycle in which they are issued. Walk entitlements are non-transferable, non-accruable and will automatically expire at the conclusion of the relevant billing period. The Service Provider is under no obligation to provide any refund, credit, or replacement for unused entitlements except as required by law.
    </p>

    <p>
      4.5 <strong>Introductory Discount Offer.</strong> As at October 2025, the Service Provider offers a promotional discount of fifty percent (50%) off the first month’s fee for new Unlimited Pawfolio Members. Following the initial discounted month, the Membership shall automatically renew at the prevailing standard rate of $1,500 per month unless cancelled in accordance with Clause 4.7. The Service Provider reserves the right to vary, suspend, or withdraw the promotion at any time without notice.
    </p>

    <p>
      4.6 <strong>Billing and Renewal.</strong> Membership fees are payable in advance on a recurring basis (monthly or weekly, as applicable) and shall be automatically charged to the Member’s nominated payment method. By entering into a Membership, the Member expressly authorises the Service Provider to process such recurring payments until the Membership is lawfully paused or cancelled. The Member warrants that sufficient funds or credit will be available for each billing cycle and acknowledges that failure to make payment may result in suspension or termination of services.
    </p>

    <p>
      4.7 <strong>Pause or Cancellation.</strong> Members may pause or cancel their Membership by providing a minimum of seven (7) days’ written notice to <a href="mailto:info@woofofwalkstreet.com">info@woofofwalkstreet.com</a>. Cancellation becomes effective at the conclusion of the then-current billing cycle. No partial-period refunds shall apply unless required by law.
    </p>

    <p>
      4.8 <strong>Default or Misuse.</strong> The Service Provider may suspend or terminate a Membership if (a) payments remain outstanding for more than seven (7) days; (b) the dog exhibits behaviour that presents a safety risk; or (c) the Member breaches any provision of these Terms. Upon termination for cause, the Member remains liable for all amounts due up to the effective date of termination.
    </p>

    <p>
      4.9 <strong>Price Adjustments.</strong> Membership pricing may be varied periodically. Any change will be published on the Service Provider’s website and will take effect from the commencement of the next billing cycle following such publication.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Service Areas and Weather Policy</h2>
    <p>Services are offered within South Melbourne, Albert Park, Middle Park, Port Melbourne, Southbank and South Yarra.  
    Walks may be rescheduled or cancelled at our discretion during extreme weather (temperatures &gt; 30&nbsp;°C, storms, high winds, or unsafe conditions).  
    When a walk is cancelled for weather or safety reasons, a replacement walk or credit will be offered.</p>

    <h2>6. Bookings and Payment</h2>

    Payment for individual walks or boarding must be made at time of booking unless otherwise agreed in writing.  
    Accepted payment methods include credit card, bank transfer or approved online processors.  
    Invoices unpaid after seven (7) days may incur interest at 12% p.a. (calculated daily).  
    Services may be suspended or cancelled until outstanding balances are cleared.</p>

    <h2>7. Cancellations and Refunds</h2>
    <p><strong>Dog Walking:</strong> ≥ 24 h notice – no fee.  &lt; 24 h – full rate charged.<br>
    <strong>Boarding (Weekend Woof Club):</strong> ≥ 48 h notice – full refund.  &lt; 48 h – non-refundable.<br>
    <strong>Force Majeure:</strong> If services cannot be performed due to illness, injury, weather or other events beyond our control, we may offer credit or rescheduling at our discretion.</p>

    <h2>8. Health and Vaccination Requirements</h2>
    <p>All dogs must hold a current C5 vaccination, be microchipped and council-registered.  
    Owners must ensure flea, tick and worming treatments are current and disclose any medical or behavioural issues before service.  
    We may refuse or cancel service where illness, contagion or unsafe behaviour is identified.</p>

    <h2>9. Behaviour and Safety</h2>
    <p>Dogs must be non-aggressive and manageable on-lead.  
    Walks are on-lead unless explicit off-lead consent is given and deemed safe by the handler.  
    We may terminate a session if behaviour compromises safety.  
    The Owner acknowledges inherent risks associated with dog walking and boarding and accepts those risks.</p>

    <h2>10. Emergency Care</h2>
    <p>The Owner authorises us to seek veterinary care if reasonably necessary for the dog’s health or safety.  
    We will attempt to contact the Owner or emergency contact before treatment where possible.  
    All vet costs are the Owner’s responsibility.  
    In urgent situations requiring immediate action, we may act without prior consent and are indemnified from liability arising from such action.</p>

    <h2>11. Owner Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>Owners must provide accurate dog information and safe equipment (leash, collar etc.).  
    If property access is required, it must be safe and secure.  
    Owners are liable for any damage or injury caused by their dog while under service.</p>

    <h2>12. Liability and Indemnity</h2>
    <p>The Owner acknowledges that dog walking and boarding carry inherent risks.  
    Except where caused by proven negligence, we are not liable for injury, loss or damage to any person, animal or property arising from the Services.  
    The Owner indemnifies and holds harmless The Woof of Walk Street Pty Ltd and its representatives from all claims and losses caused by their dog.  
    Liability for breach of statutory warranty is limited to resupply of services or payment of equivalent cost.</p>

    <h2>13. Insurance</h2>
    <p>We maintain public liability insurance of $10 million.  
    Owners are encouraged to hold their own pet insurance covering veterinary treatment, accidents and emergencies.  
    Our insurance does not extend to pre-existing conditions or Owner negligence.</p>

    <h2>14. Privacy</h2>
    <p>We manage personal information in accordance with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).  
    Full details are available in our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.  
    By using our services, you consent to the collection and use of information as described therein.</p>

    <h2>15. Termination</h2>
    <p>Either party may terminate by written notice if the other breaches these Terms and fails to remedy within seven (7) days.  
    We may terminate immediately for non-payment, health or safety risk or misrepresentation.  
    Termination does not affect accrued payment obligations or surviving clauses (including indemnity and governing law).</p>

    <h2>16. Dispute Resolution and Governing Law</h2>
    <p>Parties shall first attempt to resolve disputes through good-faith discussion.  
    Unresolved matters may be referred to mediation in Victoria.  
    This Agreement is governed by the laws of Victoria, Australia, and the parties submit to its exclusive jurisdiction.</p>
