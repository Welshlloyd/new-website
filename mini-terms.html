    <h1>Mini Terms – The Woof of Walk Street</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: October&nbsp;2025</em></p>

    <p>These Mini Terms give you a clear, easy-to-read summary of how our services work.  
    They sit alongside our <a href="/full-terms.html">Full Terms and Conditions</a> and our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.  
    By booking or paying for a service, you’re agreeing to all three documents.</p>

    <h2>Our Promise</h2>
    <p>We provide safe, one-dog-only walks and boutique weekend boarding in South Melbourne and nearby suburbs.  
    All walks are GPS-tracked and fully insured, and your dog is cared for like family.</p>

    <h2>Casual Walks</h2>
    <p>Casual or one-off walks can be booked individually and are subject to availability.  
    Prices are listed on our website.  
    Payment is required at the time of booking.  
    Please give at least 24 hours’ notice to cancel or reschedule; shorter notice may be charged in full.  
    Walks may be postponed in extreme weather (over 30 °C, heavy rain or storms) for your dog’s safety.</p>

    <h2>Memberships</h2>
    <p>We offer three flexible membership options for regular walks:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Starter – $340 /month</strong>: 4 solo walks each month.</li>
      <li><strong>Growth – $800 /month</strong>: 10 solo walks each month.</li>
      <li><strong>Unlimited Pawfolio – $1,500 /month</strong>: up to 21 weekday solo walks under our fair-use policy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Walks must be used within the same billing month and don’t roll over.  
    All memberships renew automatically until you cancel (7 days’ notice required).  
    The Unlimited plan currently includes a <strong>50 % discount for the first month</strong> for new members, after which it renews at the full rate.</p>

    <h2>Boarding (Weekend Woof Club)</h2>
    <p>Our boutique weekend boarding offers a safe, comfortable home environment from Friday to Sunday or Monday.  
    Dogs enjoy regular exercise, company, and rest.  
    Owners must provide food, medication, and any special items such as bedding or toys.  
    All dogs must be vaccinated and on flea/tick prevention before boarding.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Boarding is charged at flat weekend rates shown on our website.</li>
      <li>Payment is due when booking.</li>
      <li>Cancellations made 48 hours or more before drop-off receive a full refund; less than 48 hours’ notice is non-refundable.</li>
      <li>If a dog becomes unwell or unsafe to board, we may refuse or end the stay for everyone’s safety.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Health & Safety</h2>
    <p>Your dog must be healthy, vaccinated (C5), and council-registered.  
    Please tell us about any health or behaviour concerns before service.  
    We may stop or reschedule a walk if your dog becomes unwell or conditions are unsafe.</p>

    <h2>Emergencies</h2>
    <p>If your dog needs urgent care, we’ll contact you or your nominated vet first.  
    If we can’t reach you, we’ll act in your dog’s best interests and you’ll cover any vet costs.</p>

    <h2>Insurance & Liability</h2>
    <p>We hold public liability insurance for $10 million.  
    We’ll always take reasonable care, but dog walking and boarding carry natural risks.  
    Except where caused by our negligence, we’re not responsible for injury, illness, loss, or damage.  
    You’re responsible for any damage or injury caused by your dog.  
    Pet insurance for veterinary costs is recommended but optional.</p>

    <h2>Privacy</h2>
    <p>We respect your privacy and handle personal information in line with our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.  
    We never sell your data or share it without good reason.</p>

    <h2>Acceptance</h2>
    <p>By booking, paying for or otherwise using our services, you confirm you’ve read and agree to these Mini Terms, our <a href="/full-terms.html">Full Terms and Conditions</a>, and our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
